# Simon Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. Players must remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of colors by interacting with the game buttons. Each round adds a new color to the sequence, challenging the player's memory and attention.

## Features

- *Interactive Gameplay*: Use mouse clicks or keyboard keys to input the color sequence.
- *Dynamic Levels*: The game difficulty increases with each correct sequence.
- *Feedback Mechanisms*: Visual and audio cues indicate correct or incorrect inputs and game states.
- *Responsive Design*: The game adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
